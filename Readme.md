## Introduction

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. This project explores different OCR tools and libraries available in Python to perform text extraction.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains a wide range of tools for image and video processing.
- **Tesseract**: An open-source OCR engine that provides very high accuracy for recognizing text from images. It supports many languages and can be used for different types of documents.
- **EAST Text Detector**: A deep learning model used to detect text in images. EAST provides a good balance between speed and accuracy and is effective for detecting text in natural scenes.
- **EasyOCR**: A Python library that provides OCR capabilities using deep learning. It supports over 80 languages and is known for its ease of use and accuracy.
